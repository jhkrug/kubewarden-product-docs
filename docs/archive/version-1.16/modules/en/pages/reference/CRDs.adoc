==== AdmissionPolicySpec

AdmissionPolicySpec defines the desired state of AdmissionPolicy.

_Appears in:_

* <<_admissionpolicy,AdmissionPolicy>>

|===
| Field | Description

| `policyServer` _string_
| PolicyServer identifies an existing PolicyServer resource.

| `module` _string_
| Module is the location of the WASM module to be loaded. Can be a local file (file://), a remote file served by an HTTP server (http://, https://), or an artifact served by an OCI-compatible registry (registry://). If prefix is missing, it will default to registry:// and use that internally.

| `mode` _<<_policymode,PolicyMode>>_
| Mode defines the execution mode of this policy. Can be set to either "protect" or "monitor". If it's empty, it is defaulted to "protect". Transitioning this setting from "monitor" to "protect" is allowed, but is disallowed to transition from "protect" to "monitor". To perform this transition, the policy should be recreated in "monitor" mode instead.

| `settings` _<<_rawextension,RawExtension>>_
| Settings is a free-form object that contains the policy configuration values. x-kubernetes-embedded-resource: false

| `rules` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#rulewithoperations-v1-admissionregistration[RuleWithOperations] array_
| Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.

| `failurePolicy` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#failurepolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[FailurePolicyType]_
| FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors and timeout errors from the policy are handled. Allowed values are "Ignore" or "Fail". * "Ignore" means that an error calling the webhook is ignored and the API request is allowed to continue. * "Fail" means that an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail and the API request to be rejected. The default behaviour is "Fail"

| `mutating` _boolean_
| Mutating indicates whether a policy has the ability to mutate incoming requests or not.

| `backgroundAudit` _boolean_
| BackgroundAudit indicates whether a policy should be used or skipped when performing audit checks. If false, the policy cannot produce meaningful evaluation results during audit checks and will be skipped. The default is "true".

| `matchPolicy` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#matchpolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[MatchPolicyType]_
| matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". <ul> <li> Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. </li> <li> Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook. </li> </ul> Defaults to "Equivalent"

| `matchConditions` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#matchcondition-v1-admissionregistration[MatchCondition] array_
| MatchConditions are a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be validated. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed. If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the `params` handle in the same manner as validation expressions. The exact matching logic is (in order): 1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped. 2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is evaluated. 3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE): - If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request - If failurePolicy=Ignore, the policy is skipped. Only available if the feature gate AdmissionWebhookMatchConditions is enabled.

| `objectSelector` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta[LabelSelector]_
| ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.

| `sideEffects` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#sideeffectclass-v1-admissionregistration[SideEffectClass]_
| SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects. Acceptable values are: None, NoneOnDryRun (webhooks created via v1beta1 may also specify Some or Unknown). Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be rejected by a future step in the admission change and the side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects == Unknown or Some.

| `timeoutSeconds` _integer_
| TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default to 10 seconds.

| `namespaceSelector` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta[LabelSelector]_
| NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook. +
 +
For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as follows: <pre> "namespaceSelector": { +
&nbsp;&nbsp;"matchExpressions": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"key": "runlevel", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"operator": "NotIn", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"values": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"0", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1" +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} +
&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
} </pre> If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: <pre> "namespaceSelector": { +
&nbsp;&nbsp;"matchExpressions": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"key": "environment", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"operator": "In", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"values": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"prod", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"staging" +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} +
&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
} </pre> See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels for more examples of label selectors. +
 +
Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.

==== AdmissionPolicySpec

AdmissionPolicySpec defines the desired state of AdmissionPolicy.

_Appears in:_

* <<_admissionpolicy,AdmissionPolicy>>

|===
| Field | Description

| `policyServer` _string_
| PolicyServer identifies an existing PolicyServer resource.

| `module` _string_
| Module is the location of the WASM module to be loaded. Can be a local file (file://), a remote file served by an HTTP server (http://, https://), or an artifact served by an OCI-compatible registry (registry://).

| `mode` _<<_policymode,PolicyMode>>_
| Mode defines the execution mode of this policy. Can be set to either "protect" or "monitor". If it's empty, it is defaulted to "protect". Transitioning this setting from "monitor" to "protect" is allowed, but is disallowed to transition from "protect" to "monitor". To perform this transition, the policy should be recreated in "monitor" mode instead.

| `settings` _<<_rawextension,RawExtension>>_
| Settings is a free-form object that contains the policy configuration values. x-kubernetes-embedded-resource: false

| `rules` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#rulewithoperations-v1-admissionregistration[RuleWithOperations] array_
| Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.

| `failurePolicy` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#failurepolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[FailurePolicyType]_
| FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors and timeout errors from the policy are handled. Allowed values are "Ignore" or "Fail". * "Ignore" means that an error calling the webhook is ignored and the API request is allowed to continue. * "Fail" means that an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail and the API request to be rejected. The default behaviour is "Fail"

| `mutating` _boolean_
| Mutating indicates whether a policy has the ability to mutate incoming requests or not.

| `matchPolicy` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#matchpolicytype-v1-admissionregistration[MatchPolicyType]_
| matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". <ul> <li> Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. </li> <li> Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the webhook. </li> </ul> Defaults to "Equivalent"

| `objectSelector` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta[LabelSelector]_
| ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.

| `sideEffects` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#sideeffectclass-v1-admissionregistration[SideEffectClass]_
| SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects. Acceptable values are: None, NoneOnDryRun (webhooks created via v1beta1 may also specify Some or Unknown). Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be rejected by a future step in the admission change and the side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects == Unknown or Some.

| `timeoutSeconds` _integer_
| TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default to 10 seconds.

| `namespaceSelector` _https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta[LabelSelector]_
| NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook. +
 +
For example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with "runlevel" of "0" or "1";  you will set the selector as follows: <pre> "namespaceSelector": { +
&nbsp;&nbsp;"matchExpressions": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"key": "runlevel", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"operator": "NotIn", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"values": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"0", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1" +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} +
&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
} </pre> If instead you want to only run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: <pre> "namespaceSelector": { +
&nbsp;&nbsp;"matchExpressions": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"key": "environment", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"operator": "In", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"values": [ +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"prod", +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"staging" +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} +
&nbsp;&nbsp;] +
} </pre> See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels for more examples of label selectors. +
 +
Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches everything.
