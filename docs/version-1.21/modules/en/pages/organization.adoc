:description: How is the Kubewarden documentation organized?
:keywords: [Kubewarden, documentation, organization]
:doc-persona: [kubewarden-all]
:doc-type: [explanation]
:doc-topic: [explanation]

Kubewarden organizes project documentation as follows:

* xref:/introduction.adoc[Introduction]
* xref:/quick-start.adoc[Quick start]
* _Tutorials_—learning through examples.
* _Explanations_—underlying concepts.
* _Howtos_—getting Kubewarden tasks done.
* _Reference_
* Organization—this page
* xref:/personas.adoc[Personas]—who is Kubewarden for?
* xref:/disclosure.adoc[Security]
* xref:/glossary.adoc[Glossary]

Most of the material is in the four sections, _Tutorials_, _Explanations_, _Howtos_, and _Reference_. There may be overlap as the sections are not mutually exclusive. The Kubewarden project tries to follow the link:https://diataxis.fr/[Diátaxis] documentation framework.

== Navigation

The left hand contents menu always indicates your current document location. The right hand sections menu shows the current page sections. There is also a 'breadcrumbs' feature at the top of the main content panel on each page.

== Search

A search box facility is in the header panel of each page.

== Editing

A link to the page source on GitHub is at the bottom of each page.

== Other resources
