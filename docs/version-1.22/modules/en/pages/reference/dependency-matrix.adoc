This page lists the dependencies of Kubewarden, with their relevant
version constraints. Versions outside of the provided ranges may work but are
not tested.

== Opentelemetry, metrics and tracing dependencies

At the time of writing, the https://opentelemetry.io[Opentelemetry] stack
keeps improving. Still, is not yet stable, and unannounced

range of Opentelemetry, metrics and tracing stack.
