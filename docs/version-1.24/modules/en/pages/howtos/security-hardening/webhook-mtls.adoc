This guide shows you how to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) for all the webhooks used
by the Kubewarden stack when using https://k3s.io/[K3s] as your Kubernetes
distribution.

== Prerequisites

Before installing K3s, you need to create a certificate authority (CA) and a
client certificate to use to secure the communication between the Kubewarden
webhooks and the Kubernetes API server.

As a first step, create the `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs` directory:

[source,console]
----
sudo mkdir -p /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs
----

=== Create a root CA and the client certificate

As `root` user, change directory to the `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs`
directory and create all needed certificates:

[source,console]
----
export FQDN=mtls.kubewarden.io

# Create CA
openssl req -nodes -batch -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt

# Create CSR
openssl req -nodes -batch -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout client.key -out client.csr \
    -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:$FQDN"

# Create CRT
openssl x509 -req -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -in client.csr -out client.crt -days 365 -CAcreateserial \
    -extfile <(echo "subjectAltName=DNS:$FQDN")

# Print CRT
openssl x509 -text -noout -in client.crt
----

The following files should have been created:

* `client.crt`
* `client.csr`
* `client.key`
* `rootCA.crt`
* `rootCA.key`
* `rootCA.srl`

=== Create the Kubernetes configuration file

Create the `/etc/rancher/admission/admission.yaml` file with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
# /etc/rancher/admission/admission.yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
- name: ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
  configuration:
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
    kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
    kubeConfigFile: "/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/kubeconfig"
- name: MutatingAdmissionWebhook
  configuration:
    apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
    kind: WebhookAdmissionConfiguration
    kubeConfigFile: "/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/kubeconfig"
----

Finally, create a `kubeconfig` file at `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/kubeconfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
# /etc/rancher/admission/kubeconfig
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
users:
- name: '*.kubewarden.svc' # namespace where the kubewarden stack is deployed
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/client.crt
    client-key: /etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/client.key
----

=== Create a K3s configuration file

Create a K3s configuration file at `/etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
# /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml
kube-apiserver-arg:
- admission-control-config-file=/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/admission.yaml
----

== Install k3s

Install k3s using the following command:

[source,console]
----
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
----

Wait for the installation to complete.

== Install the Kubewarden stack

=== Prerequisites

The certificate of the root CA, that issued the Kubernetes client certificate,
must be made available to the Kubewarden stack.

The root CA is available at `/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/rootCA.crt` on
the Kubernetes node. Its content has to be put into a `ConfigMap` under the
`kubewarden` namespace. The contents of the `rootCA.crt` file must be stored in
a key named `client-ca.crt`.

First, create the `kubewarden` namespace:

[source,console]
----
kubectl create namespace kubewarden
----

Then create the `ConfigMap` in it. The following command, run on the Kubernetes
node, does that:

[source,console]
----
kubectl create configmap -n kubewarden api-server-mtls \
    --from-file=client-ca.crt=/etc/rancher/k3s/admission/certs/rootCA.crt
----

The resulting `ConfigMap` is named `api-server-mtls`.

=== Install the Kubewarden stack

Install the Kubewarden stack as described in the
link:../../quick-start.adoc[quickstart guide]. Follow all the steps, but when
installing the `kubewarden-controller` Helm chart, make sure to enable the
following values:

* `mTLS.enable`: must be set to `true`.
* `mTLS.configMapName`: must be set to the name of the `ConfigMap` that was
  previously created.

Given the `ConfigMap` was named `api-server-mtls`, the Helm command to install
the `kubewarden-controller` is:

[source,console]
----
helm install --wait -n kubewarden kubewarden-controller kubewarden/kubewarden-controller \
    --set mTLS.enable=true \
    --set mTLS.configMapName=api-server-mtls
----

Once this command finishes, the Kubewarden stack is installed and its webhooks
are secured with mTLS.
