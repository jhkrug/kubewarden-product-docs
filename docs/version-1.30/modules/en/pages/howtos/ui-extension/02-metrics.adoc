Rancher has a Cluster Tool for monitoring that leverages Grafana and
Prometheus. You can use this tool, integrating it with {project-name}, to
view overall metrics for a Policy Server or metrics for a given policy.

[CAUTION]
====

You need a cluster with at least 4 cores to install the Monitoring tool.

====


== Prerequisites

You need the Prometheus Operator. Follow
xref:howtos/telemetry/30-metrics-qs.adoc#_install_prometheus[these
instructions] to install it.

== Install

=== Create the ServiceMonitors

* Import the manifest to create the ServiceMonitors.
* You need to specify the {short-project-name} installation namespace

These steps are an adpatation from the
xref:howtos/telemetry/30-metrics-qs.adoc[telemetry metrics instructions].

=== Enable telemetry for your `rancher-kubewarden-controller` resource

* Navigate to Apps & Marketplace → Installed Apps.
* Select the `Edit/Upgrade` action for your `rancher-kubewarden-controller`
  resource.
* Edit the YAML for `telemetry` to be `enabled: "true"` and verify that the metrics
  port is correct.

    metrics:

[NOTE]
====

You may need to redeploy your Monitoring resources for the new ConfigMap to
load. You can do this from Workloads → Deployments. Select all the resources in
the `cattle-monitoring-system` namespace and select the `Redeploy` action.

====


=== Create the Grafana dashboard ConfigMap for Policies and Policy Server

[NOTE]
====
This method is suitable for air-gapped installations.
====


The dashboards are unique between Policy Server and Policies, so you need to separate
creation.

Within the detail view for a Policy Server or a specific Policy:

* Navigate to the "Metrics" tab.
* Follow the prompt to create the ConfigMap.
* Reload the page to update the Grafana view
(Grafana may be slow to acknowledge the new dashboard).

You should be able to view the metrics for a Policy Server, or any given Policy
on the detail page for each respective resource. You can also view the
{short-project-name} dashboards within the Grafana UI, or the events from the
Prometheus UI.
